Current tasks
=============

  * Determine relevance of the new article (preview) in
    [research/join-calculus/Compiling Pattern Matching in Join-Patterns.pdf]

  * Push the revised version of the synopsis to github (Ulrik.. :p)

  * Discuss the CHAM and Join Calculus (JC) and others (BRICS), with the
    intention of producing a 'digest' for Andrzej, along with some thoughts on
    the design of the programming language, or at least some thoughts on what
    is required of it by the environment, that the programs execute in
    (computationally as well as physically)

As all this should be done before tuesday, it seems that our weekend is
earmarked for article reading.
