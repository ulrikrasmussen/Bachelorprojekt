We investigate the usefulness and feasibility of using a distributed process
calculus, the join-calculus, as a basic programming model for programming
distributed embedded devices such as sensor-networks. We develop a prototype
programming language based on join-calculus, and provide an operational
semantics that avoids dependency on structural equivalence for execution, along
with our own extensions that enables us to model unreliable communication
between physical devices. We implement the language in Haskell, and develop a
set of programs for a constructed use case, which we use as a basis for
evaluating the join-calculus.
