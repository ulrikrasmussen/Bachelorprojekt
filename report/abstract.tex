We investigate the usefulness and feasibility of using a distributed process
calculus, the join-calculus, as a basic programming model for distributed
embedded devices such as sensor networks.
We develop a prototype programming language based on join-calculus, and provide
an operational semantics that avoids bidirectional reduction rules, resulting
in a more directed rule set than the one provided in the defining
article\cite{fournet1996reflexive}. The semantics are further extended with a
way to model unreliable communication between physical units in a deterministic
way.
We implement the language in Haskell, and develop a set of programs for a
constructed use case about temperature sensors in a warehouse, which we use as
a basis for evaluating the join-calculus.
