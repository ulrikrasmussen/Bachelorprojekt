\fixme{we may need a clearer definition of ``mobile'' and ``distributed''}
Join-calculus is a process calculus for modelling mobile and distributed
systems, communicating in an asynchronous way. It is described in
\cite{fournet1996reflexive} using an extension of the \emph{Chemical Abstract
Machine}\cite{berry1989chemical} (or CHAM) as a model for computation: The
\emph{reflexive} CHAM.
