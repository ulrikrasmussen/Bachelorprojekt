In order to assess to some degree the usefulness of programming distributed
devices in the style of the join calculus, we have decided to investigate by
constructing miniature examples, which we will then evaluate upon.

As the scenarios we intend to model involve communication mostly over
unreliable channels, it is interesting to look into the ways of
expressing communication protocols at the level of the application,
that addresses the issue of guaranteed delivery.

Therefore we have programmed a use case featuring a sensor network,
and a general purpose rudimentary library for guaranteed message
delivery to deal with the simulated packet losses between the sensors.

Lastly we include a discussion of some of the implications of the distributed
model of computation and identify potentially interesting subjects for future
work.
