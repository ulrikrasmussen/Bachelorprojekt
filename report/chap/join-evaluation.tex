In order to assess to some degree the usefulness of programming
distributed devices in the style of the join calculus \fixme{Hm. It'd
be nice with a clearer verbal distinction between the calculus and the
programming language}, we have decided to investigate by constructing
miniature examples, which we will then evaluate upon.

As the scenarios we intend to model involve communication mostly over
unreliable channels, it is interesting to look into the ways of
expressing communication protocols at the level of the application,
that addresses the issue of guaranteed delivery.

Therefore we have programmed a use case featuring a sensor network,
and a general purpose rudimentary library for guaranteed message
delivery to deal with the simulated packet losses between the sensors.
