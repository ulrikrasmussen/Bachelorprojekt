\section{General discussion}

While we have been able to successfully produce sample programs without the need
to resolve to using cumbersome encodings, and demonstrated the rather
transparent way the proxying pattern could be applied to deal satisfactorily
with the issues of unreliable communication, some fundamental implementation
issues need to be solved before the use of the join calculus as a foundation for
distributed programming can be said to be realistic.

Of these are
  * Global name routing
  * Migration security
  * Distributed garbage collection
    - Mention techniques to leverage manual garbage collection.

* potential use cases
  - signal processing (time?)
  - computation servers / grid
  - RPC
  - ...

* patterns
  - distribution
  - garbage collection
