Report disposition
==================

1. Introduce the join calculus informally -- talk about the
   calculus, its place among calculi(and the problems it
   addresses?).

2. Introduce the specific problem that we investigate and
   present our method (i.e. use-case and discussion), and
   grossly sketch up the implementation.

3. Present the syntax and semantics.

4. Present and discuss the use-case and retransmission
   protocol. Evaluate the calculus' usefulness based on the
   use case.

5. Additionally, present potential use cases and possible
   patterns used in implementation, and argue to the extent
   possible about the elegantnes of the join expression of
   the programs.

6. Discuss unsolved problems / shortcomings of the calculus
   (global name routing, security..)

Syntax and Semantics:
=====================

1. Introduce the calculus:
   a. Introduce core join
   b. Describe mobility extension
   c. Describe pattern matching extension
   d. Describe realtime extension

2. Summarize syntax.

3. Present semantics.

Use case disposition:
=====================

1. Present usecase, inspiration.

2. Introduce scenario.
   a) Assumptions of underlying system.
   b) number of msc etc.

3. Show overview pseudo-code and describe implementation.
   a) Show program output.

4. Discuss generalisability of the program.
   a) Argue that more general server-sensor queries may be
      constructed,
   b) And that more general ad-hoc registration is possible.
